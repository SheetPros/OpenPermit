Distilled Ontology Overview
The goal is to streamline the ontology for practical use in OpenTax and OpenPermit, reducing complexity while maintaining interoperability for permit applications (e.g., building permits with DWG/DXF blueprints) and business tax transactions (e.g., filings with CSV/JSON data). The distilled version focuses on essential entities, relationships, and standards, making it easier to implement with gRPC and integrate into APIs.

Core Classes
Document (Abstract class for all file types)
Properties:
formatType (e.g., JSON, CSV, PDF, DWG, DXF, SHP, KML)
fileSize
Subclasses:
JSONDocument: For structured permit/tax metadata (jsonSchema).
CSVDocument: For tabular tax records (delimiter).
PDFDocument: For signed forms (hasDigitalSignature).
DWGDocument: For proprietary CAD blueprints (cadVersion).
DXFDocument: For interoperable CAD files (geometricEntities).
PermitApplication (Permit process entity)
Properties:
applicationID
status (e.g., pending, approved)
submissionDate
BusinessTaxTransaction (Tax process entity)
Properties:
transactionID
taxCode
amount
Project (seeking permits)
Properties:
projectID
location
BusinessEntity (Applicant or taxpayer)
Properties:
entityID
taxID
Standard (Interoperability standard)
Properties:
standardID (e.g., IFC, ISO 20022, BLDS)
version
Key Relationships
hasDocument: Links PermitApplication or BusinessTaxTransaction to Documents (e.g., PermitApplication hasDocument DWGDocument).
conformsTo: Associates Documents with Standards (e.g., DXFDocument conformsTo IFC).
isSubmittedBy: Connects PermitApplication or BusinessTaxTransaction to BusinessEntity.
references: Ties Documents to Projects (e.g., DWGDocument references Project).
Standards Simplified
IFC: For DWG/DXF (CAD interoperability in permits).
ISO 20022: For JSON/CSV (tax transactions).
BLDS: For PermitApplication processes.
OData: For API endpoints (queryable data access).
Distilled Diagram (Mermaid Syntax)
Here’s a simplified version of the ontology as a Mermaid class diagram, focusing on clarity and core functionality:


Protobuf Definition
Define the ontology in Protobuf for gRPC, focusing on core classes and relationships:

proto

Copy
syntax = "proto3";

message Document {
    string formatType = 1;
    int32 fileSize = 2;
    oneof subtype {
        JSONDocument json = 3;
        CSVDocument csv = 4;
        PDFDocument pdf = 5;
        DWGDocument dwg = 6;
        DXFDocument dxf = 7;
    }
}

message JSONDocument {
    string jsonSchema = 1;
}

message CSVDocument {
    string delimiter = 1;
}

message PDFDocument {
    bool hasDigitalSignature = 1;
}

message DWGDocument {
    string cadVersion = 1;
}

message DXFDocument {
    string geometricEntities = 1;
}

message PermitApplication {
    string applicationID = 1;
    string status = 2;
    string submissionDate = 3;
    repeated Document documents = 4;
    string submittedBy = 5; // BusinessEntity ID
}

message BusinessTaxTransaction {
    string transactionID = 1;
    string taxCode = 2;
    float amount = 3;
    repeated Document documents = 4;
    string submittedBy = 5; // BusinessEntity ID
}

message Project {
    string projectID = 1;
    string location = 2;
}

message BusinessEntity {
    string entityID = 1;
    string taxID = 2;
}

message Standard {
    string standardID = 1;
    string version = 2;
}
gRPC Service
Define a gRPC service to query and manage the ontology:

proto

Copy
service OntologyService {
    rpc GetPermitDocuments (PermitRequest) returns (DocumentList) {}
    rpc GetTaxDocuments (TaxRequest) returns (DocumentList) {}
}

message PermitRequest {
    string applicationID = 1;
}

message TaxRequest {
    string transactionID = 1;
}

message DocumentList {
    repeated Document documents = 1;
}
Integration Notes
Backend (gRPC): Use gRPC to handle backend processing, e.g., parsing DWG/DXF files into IFC-compliant Protobuf messages or aggregating CSV tax records.
Public API (REST/OData): Expose a REST layer with OData endpoints (e.g., /permits/{id}/documents) for client access, converting Protobuf to JSON.
Tools: Use Autodesk Forge for DWG/DXF parsing, PyPDF2 for PDF extraction, and pandas for CSV handling, ensuring compliance with IFC, ISO 20022, and BLDS.
Benefits of Distillation
Clarity: The simplified ontology is easier to understand and implement, especially for developers working on OpenTax and OpenPermit.
Performance: gRPC with Protobuf ensures faster data transfer for large files (e.g., DWG, CSV), aligning with your request for the latest, faster protocol.
Interoperability: Retains core standards (IFC, ISO 20022, BLDS, OData) to ensure seamless integration across systems.
Actionable: The distilled model is ready for immediate integration into APIs, with clear mappings for permit and tax workflows.
Next Steps
Implement Protobuf and gRPC:
Generate gRPC stubs for the Protobuf definitions in Python (for OpenTaxForms) and C# (for OpenPermit’s .NET).
Test with sample DWG blueprints and CSV tax records.
Expose REST/OData Layer:
Add OData endpoints to OpenPermit’s Swagger API for querying permit documents.
Enhance OpenTaxForms’ ReSTful API to support tax document retrieval.
Visualize for Stakeholders:
Use the Mermaid diagram in documentation for OpenTax/OpenPermit GitHub repositories.
Share with the community (e.g., @openpermit on Twitter) to gather feedback.
Validate Standards Compliance:
Test DWG/DXF files against IFC using tools like BIMServer.
Validate JSON/CSV tax data against ISO 20022 schemas.
