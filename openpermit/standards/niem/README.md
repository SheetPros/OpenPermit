# NIEM Standard

This folder is intended to hold the [NIEM-Releases](https://github.com/NIEM/NIEM-Releases) repository as a Git submodule pinned to tag `6.0`. Due to the sandbox environment, the submodule could not be initialized. Clone the repository and check out tag `6.0` into `openpermit/standards/niem/NIEM-Releases` before running the schema build script.
