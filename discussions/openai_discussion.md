# OpenAI Models Standards Integration Discussion

## Implementation Status
- Language model capabilities
- Code generation standards
- API integration protocols

## Standards Alignment
1. IEEE 7000â„¢ Series Compliance
   - Ethics guidelines
   - Fairness measures
   - Transparency requirements

2. ISO 27001 Integration
   - Security controls
   - Risk management
   - Documentation requirements

## Discussion Points
1. How do we standardize model outputs across different versions?
2. What security measures are needed for code generation?
3. How can we ensure consistent API behavior?

## Action Items
- [ ] Map current capabilities to standards
- [ ] Document security measures
- [ ] Define integration tests
- [ ] Schedule review meeting
