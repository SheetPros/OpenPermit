# Grok AI Standards Integration Discussion

## Current Implementation
- Real-time data processing patterns
- X/Twitter data integration standards
- Pattern recognition protocols

## Standards Alignment
1. ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 Compliance
   - Data quality measures
   - Processing transparency
   - Performance metrics

2. NIST Framework Integration
   - Risk assessment methodology
   - Monitoring requirements
   - Validation procedures

## Open Questions
1. How do we standardize real-time processing across different platforms?
2. What metrics should be used for pattern recognition accuracy?
3. How can we ensure consistent data quality across sources?

## Next Steps
- [ ] Document current compliance levels
- [ ] Propose integration patterns
- [ ] Define cross-platform metrics
- [ ] Schedule technical review
