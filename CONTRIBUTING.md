# Contributing to OpenPermit

We love your input! We want to make contributing to OpenPermit as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Setting up for Testing

Run `npm install` before executing `npm test` or opening the browser test page. This installs all required dependencies.


## Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Update the documentation
4. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same license that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker]
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue!
