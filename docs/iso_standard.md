# Relevant ISO Standards

OpenPermit references international standards to encourage global interoperability. Key ISO documents include:

- **ISO 19650** – Organization and digitization of information about buildings and civil engineering works, including building information modelling (BIM). It defines collaborative processes for managing information across the built environment lifecycle.
- **ISO 37120** – Sustainable cities and communities. This standard provides indicators for city services and quality of life, supporting open-data initiatives.
- **ISO 19005-3 (PDF/A-3)** – Standardized approach for long-term archiving of documents with embedded files. Useful when attaching supporting evidence within permit submissions.

Following these standards helps agencies integrate OpenPermit workflows with existing BIM and smart city practices.
