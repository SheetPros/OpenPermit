# OpenPermit White Paper

This brief white paper outlines the motivation and vision for the OpenPermit project.

OpenPermit aims to streamline construction permitting by providing an open data layer that bridges BIM, GIS and document standards. By aligning with NIEM, BLDS and EPA schemas, it enables agencies and builders to validate submissions once and reuse them across jurisdictions. The platform's reference APIs, ontology and workflow examples are designed for modular adoption.

Key objectives include:

1. **Open interoperability** – JSON‑LD mappings allow data exchange across BIM and GIS tools while preserving context.
2. **Standards compliance** – Generators produce NIEM‑ and BLDS‑aligned schemas to help meet federal and environmental reporting rules.
3. **Open‑data readiness** – CKAN integration scripts publish validated permit datasets directly to public portals.
4. **Secure automation** – Built‑in validation and workflow engines reduce manual reviews and enforce NIST controls.

The ultimate goal is a vendor‑neutral, extensible framework for efficient, transparent permitting.
