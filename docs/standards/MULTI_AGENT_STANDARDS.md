   - Map model capabilities to standards
   - Document compliance approaches
   - Propose unified solutions

3. Discussion Framework
   - Cross-repository issue linking
   - Standards-focused comments
   - Integration proposals
   - Compliance verification

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Repository Structure
   ```
   /standards
     /iso
     /nist
