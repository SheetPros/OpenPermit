# Brand Disambiguation

## OpenPermit 2.0 vs Legacy Projects

### This Project (OpenPermit 2.0)
- **Founded**: 2024
- **Focus**: Modern JSON-LD based permitting infrastructure
- **Architecture**: Cloud-native, API-first
- **Status**: Active development with municipal pilots

### Legacy openpermit.org (Discontinued)
- **Active Period**: 2015-2019
- **Focus**: Basic permit tracking
- **Status**: Project discontinued, domain expired
- **Migration**: No data migration needed (different architecture)

### Why the Name Similarity?
We chose "OpenPermit" because it accurately describes our mission: creating open, interoperable permitting systems. While a previous project used similar naming, our architecture, goals, and implementation are entirely different.
