# OpenPermit

Ultimately Efficient Permitting - Distilled for simplicity, interoperability, speed and security. 

Seek & maintain the most efficient method for Municipal entities to host and interact with businesses/individuals.

This Open-Source repo can be hosted ubiquitously (platform agnostic). 

This repo aligns with the SheetPros/OpenTax concept extending OData and UK Tax Digitization principles as models for success while seeking and incorporating state-of-the-art interoperable frameworks.

Why this matters:

https://subnational.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploretopics/dealing-with-construction-permits/why-matters

The basics:

Decoupled Standard/Interoperable Data Layer (intra_agency,agency_entity,agency_individual). 

Users and user groups have access to the appropriate, secure data. 

User groups will have unlimited choice for the application and abstraction layer allowing entites to enhance their interaction with permitting systems. 

This broadens the competitive landscape and focus on optimizing specific permitting cases. 

Use the best of class - maximal reliability, maximal security, standards-based-interoperability. 

This focus includes MCP Agent frameworks, block-chain, traditional business data standards and engineering geodata attribution, markup standards where they are best in class. 

Culminating open-source projects, comments & feedback, Sponsors, collaborators: Virginia Municipalities and the tech community.

## Standards

# OpenPermit Data Standards

## Overview
OpenPermit defines a standards-based data layer for permitting and tax transactions, ensuring interoperability across municipalities and agencies.

## Standards
1. **BLDS**: For `Application` and `Permit` data.
   - Schema: JSON-LD with `id`, `status`, `submittedDate`.
   - Validation: JSON Schema.
2. **IFC**: For `Document` (DWG/DXF).
   - Schema: JSON-LD with `ifcVersion`, `entities`.
   - Validation: IFC EXPRESS.
3. **ISO 20022**: For `Transaction`.
   - Schema: JSON-LD with `amount`, `currency`.
   - Validation: ISO 20022 JSON schema.
4. **GeoJSON**: For `Location`.
   - Schema: GeoJSON Feature with `geometry`, `properties`.
   - Validation: GeoJSON schema.
5. **JSON-LD**: For semantic metadata.
   - Schema: `@context` linking to BLDS, IFC, ISO 20022.
6. **OData**: For queryable metadata.
   - Schema: EDM with entities (`Application`, `Document`).
   - Validation: OData CSDL.
7. **RDF/OWL**: For semantic relationships.
   - Schema: OWL ontology in `ontology/open_data_ontology.owl`.
   - Validation: SHACL.

## Example
```json
{
  "@context": ["http://schema.org", "http://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC"],
  "@type": "PermitApplication",
  "id": "APP123",
  "status": "submitted",
  "submittedDate": "2025-04-20",
  "documents": [
    {
      "@type": "DWGDocument",
      "id": "DOC789",
      "ifcVersion": "IFC4"
    }
