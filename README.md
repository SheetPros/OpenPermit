Why this matters:

https://subnational.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploretopics/dealing-with-construction-permits/why-matters

The basics:

Decoupled Standard/Interoperable Data Layer (intra_agency,agency_entity,agency_individual). 

Users and user groups have access to the appropriate, secure data. 

User groups will have unlimited choice for the application and abstraction layer allowing entites to enhance their interaction with permitting systems. 

This broadens the competitive landscape and focus on optimizing specific permitting cases. 

Use the best of class - maximal reliability, maximal security, standards-based-interoperability. 

This focus includes MCP Agent frameworks, block-chain, traditional business data standards and engineering geodata attribution, markup standards where they are best in class.
