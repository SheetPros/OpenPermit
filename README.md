# OpenPermit

Ultimately Efficient Permitting - Distilled to simplicity, interoperability, speed and security. 

The point of this repo is to seek & maintain the most efficient method for Municipal entities to host and interact with businesses/individuals.

This Open-Source repo can be hosted ubiquitously (platform agnostic). 

This repo aligns with the SheetPros/OpenTax concept extending OData and UK Tax Digitization principles as models for success while seeking and incorporating the leading-edge of available tech today.

The basics:

Decoupled Standard/Interoperable Data Layer (intra_agency,agency_entity,agency_individual). 

Users and user groups have access to the appropriate, secure data. 

User groups will have unlimited choice for the application and abstraction layer allowing entites to enhance their interaction with permitting systems. 

This broadens the competitive landscape and focus on optimizing specific permitting cases. 

Use the best of class - maximal reliability, maximal security, standards-based-interoperability. 

This focus includes MCP Agent frameworks, block-chain, traditional business data standards and engineering geodata attribution, markup standards where they are best in class.
